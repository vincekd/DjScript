DjScript is a date library for javascript that makes the formatting and parsing of date strings much easier.  It almost exactly like the php function "date()", taking the same arguments and using the same formatting syntax, with additions.

The first argument is the format, e.g. "Y_m_d" would yield "2011_07_25".  The second argument can either be a javascript Date object, or a string you want parsed into a Date object and then formatted.  I've supported as many of the most common date strings I could think of, but if you need others let me know.

Alternatively, you can pass in null or an empty string for the first argument and get a date object returned.
